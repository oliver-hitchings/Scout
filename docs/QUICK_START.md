# Quick Start

Scout is a local-first opportunity finder for Windows, macOS and Linux. It keeps your career data in a private workspace and uses Codex or Claude to help search and assess opportunities. It never sends applications or outreach.

## 1. Install and launch

Download the Windows installer and its `checksums.txt` from the same GitHub release. Compare the installer SHA-256 hash before running it:

```powershell
$Installer = Get-Item .\Scout-*-windows-x64.exe
Get-FileHash -LiteralPath $Installer.FullName -Algorithm SHA256
```

An unsigned beta may trigger Microsoft SmartScreen. A matching checksum proves file integrity, not publisher trust. Scout installs for the current user under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Scout` and does not require administrator rights.

For a source checkout, install Node.js 24 LTS, then run `npm ci` and `npm start`.

## 2. Create or restore a private workspace

On first launch choose **Set up Scout for the first time** for a new local workspace, or **Restore my existing workspace** when moving to another computer. Accept the default `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Scout Workspace`, or select another private local folder before launch with `SCOUT_WORKSPACE`.

Scout works fully without GitHub. Optional private backup requires Git and Git Credential Manager. Scout guides a new user to create an empty GitHub repository named `scout-workspace`, select **Private**, and paste its credential-free HTTPS URL. Git Credential Manager performs browser sign-in; Scout never asks for a GitHub token.

When enabling backup, choose a recovery passphrase and save the one-time emergency recovery key. Normal CV, profile and tracker files remain readable in the private repository so Git history remains useful. `.env`, generated PDF/DOCX files, chat transcripts and Scout recovery state are stored as authenticated encrypted blobs. Do not make the repository public.

Scout's restore flow clones into a temporary directory, validates the workspace, decrypts recovery data and installs it only after Scout doctor passes. On the new computer, sign in to Codex or Claude again and explicitly choose whether to re-enable host startup and scheduled scans.

From a source checkout:

```powershell
node tools/scout.mjs workspace init --workspace "$HOME\Documents\Scout Workspace"
```

The workspace contains `workspace.json`, your profile, CV, tracker, reports, applications, imports, logs and ignored credentials. It is separate from application files and survives upgrades and uninstall. Automatic backup can be disabled without deleting local work or existing private GitHub history.

## 3. Connect an AI provider

Install and sign in to either Codex or Claude Code using the provider's official instructions. Scout does not collect the provider password or token.

```powershell
codex login
codex login status

# Or
claude auth login
claude auth status
```

The beta installer currently provides the Scout UI shortcut but does not add the
`scout` command to `PATH`. Use the UI diagnostics, or invoke the bundled CLI
explicitly when following command-line examples:

```powershell
$ScoutNode = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Scout\runtime\ScoutRuntime.exe"
$ScoutCli = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Scout\app\tools\scout.mjs"
& $ScoutNode $ScoutCli doctor --workspace "$HOME\Documents\Scout Workspace"
```

In a source checkout, `node tools/scout.mjs doctor` is equivalent. A globally
available `scout` command is only present when the package has been linked or
installed separately.

See [Providers](PROVIDERS.md) if detection or authentication fails.

## 4. Add your CV and preferences

The first-run wizard accepts selectable-text PDF, DOCX, Markdown and plain text files up to 10 MB. Scanned PDFs need OCR before import. Review the extracted text and every generated profile/configuration change; Scout must not invent missing facts.

Complete the setup questions for your role families, sectors, locations, minimum salary, commute preferences, exclusions and preferred writing tone. Scout then makes one schema-constrained proposal from those fields and the imported evidence. Review or discard the five staged files before activation. See [AI Setup](AI_SETUP.md) for details or [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) for manual editing.

Setup, Settings, CV options and side drawers keep keyboard focus inside the active dialog and return it to the control that opened the dialog. Press **Escape** to close an optional dialog or drawer. Mandatory first-run setup remains open until its required action is complete.

Scout uses these approved answers, the imported CV and generated search lanes to find and score jobs. It does not inspect unrelated Codex/Claude conversations or automatically infer a career from previous AI usage.

### Tailor a CV

Choose **Create custom CV** on an opportunity. Scout recommends Google XYZ for genuine achievement bullets and a separate natural-voice review, but both options can be switched off for each CV.

With XYZ enabled, Scout compares the role with confirmed evidence and asks only for missing accomplishment, outcome or method details, one question at a time. Every question can be skipped and the interview can be finished early. Never supply an invented number; a truthful qualitative outcome is valid.

Scout stores the selected options, confirmed answers and bullet provenance in the private application folder. The quality panel shows blocking evidence/rendering failures separately from overridable writing warnings. A CV remains labelled **Draft** until enabled checks pass or you explicitly choose **Use draft anyway**. Any later edit invalidates the prior review or override.

The CV library also renders the approved master Markdown as a clearly labelled reference PDF. Master and tailored renders run in the background, show progress and use source hashes so an old PDF cannot appear current after an edit.

From a source checkout, rerun the same review with:

```powershell
node tools/scout.mjs cv quality <company-slug> --workspace "$HOME\Documents\Scout Workspace"
```

## 5. Add sources

Public/ATS sources work without Adzuna. Adzuna is optional and uses `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_API_KEY` stored in the workspace `.env`. See [Adzuna and Sources](ADZUNA_AND_SOURCES.md).

## 6. Run and review the first scan

Scout starts the first supervised scan automatically when the required setup answers have been saved. Keep Scout open while it searches; setup and the dashboard show the current phase, elapsed time and an approximate remaining range. Use **Scan now** in the dashboard header for another scan. The command-line equivalent is:

```powershell
& $ScoutNode $ScoutCli doctor
& $ScoutNode $ScoutCli scan --provider codex --mode primary
```

Use `claude` instead if selected. Review the dated report and tracker changes. Confirm that exclusions, salary handling and locations behave as intended before relying on results.

If the supervised primary scan keeps zero roles, Scout automatically performs one broader discovery pass. It widens source queries, not your approved gates: salary, hard exclusions, location/commute, mandatory evidence and scoring remain in force. The completed result stays visible as “reviewed / kept”; **Review this scan** shows concise reasons for every discarded candidate without adding weak roles to the tracker.

The **All** tab is a searchable table. On a phone, swipe the labelled table region horizontally to reach commute, stage, status and last-checked columns; filtering keeps the text cursor and in-progress keyboard composition in place.

## 7. Enable daily scans (optional)

During setup, choose the local daily time and enable the schedule after the first healthy scan. Return to **Settings → First scan** to change or disable it later. The command-line equivalent is:

```powershell
& $ScoutNode $ScoutCli schedule install --time 07:30 --provider codex
& $ScoutNode $ScoutCli schedule status
```

Scheduled scans use Windows Task Scheduler, macOS launchd, or a Linux systemd user timer. See [Automation](AUTOMATION.md).

## 8. Use Scout from your phone or laptop (optional)

Keep local-only use if it is all you need. No Scout account, Tailscale installation or cloud service is required.

To make this computer the one active Scout host, install and sign in to [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download), then open **Settings -> Private Remote Access**. Confirm the detected owner, leave the automatic HTTPS port selected and enable access. On Windows, automatic startup is selected by default so the host returns after Windows sign-in.

Install Tailscale on your phone or laptop with the same owner login, open the HTTPS address Scout displays, and use the browser's **Add to Home Screen** or **Install app** action. Your browser connects to the host's existing workspace and Scout/Codex chat; it does not create another workspace copy. The host must remain awake, online and signed in. See [Private Remote Access](PRIVATE_REMOTE_ACCESS.md) for access rules, recovery behaviour, cost/terms and troubleshooting.

For an always-on single-owner Ubuntu host, use [Host Scout on a private VPS](INSTALL_VPS.md). It keeps Scout loopback-only and uses a dedicated unprivileged user service to recover after reboot.
