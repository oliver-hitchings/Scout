# Troubleshooting

Start with `scout doctor --workspace PATH`. Keep error reports synthetic and never attach a real workspace, `.env`, CV or provider log.

## Scout cannot find the workspace

Confirm the directory contains `workspace.json`. Check `--workspace` first, then `SCOUT_WORKSPACE`; command-line selection takes precedence. Quote paths containing spaces. Run `scout workspace init` only for a new/empty intended destination.

## Invalid or newer workspace schema

Restore valid JSON from a private backup or correct the reported field. Do not reduce `schemaVersion` to bypass a newer-schema error; install a compatible Scout version. Migration backups are under `.scout/backups/`.

## Provider not found or not authenticated

Run the provider's `--version` and authentication status command in a new PowerShell window. Restart Scout after `PATH` changes. Clear unsupported `ai.model` overrides. See [Providers](PROVIDERS.md).

## CV import fails

Files must be PDF, DOCX, Markdown or plain text and no larger than 10 MB. Password-protected, malformed and image-only/scanned PDFs cannot be extracted reliably; decrypt or OCR a private copy locally, then review extracted text before accepting it.

## Adzuna is unavailable

Confirm both variables exist in the selected workspace `.env`, without quotes accidentally becoming part of their values. Test `scout source adzuna`. Missing Adzuna credentials are non-fatal; invalid credentials, quota and network failures should be recorded as reduced coverage.

## Scheduled scan does not run

Check `scout schedule status`, confirm the native scheduler entry points to the current application/workspace and run `scout schedule run-now`. Inspect workspace logs and Task Scheduler, launchd, or systemd-user history. Remove/reinstall the schedule after moving a workspace.

## Port or UI problem

Scout serves the UI on loopback at `http://127.0.0.1:8459`. Close stale Scout processes before retrying. Do not expose the port to the network. From source, run `npm test` before `npm start` and inspect terminal output.

If an already-open page still shows an older layout after Scout itself was upgraded, refresh it once. Current Scout builds compare the loaded interface with the serving process and display **Scout updated — Refresh Scout** when they differ. Scout never performs that refresh silently; save or close active CV edits, chats, scans and settings first.

The same protection applies when a new service worker is ready: Scout keeps the refresh pending while CV edits, settings, chats, scans or setup operations are active. A remote restart requires explicit confirmation and is refused until active work has drained; retry after the operation finishes.

The header backup status opens **Backup details**. Use **Advanced backup settings** from there for configuration. The main **Settings** button opens the sectioned settings hub; first-run onboarding appears automatically only for an unfinished workspace.

On macOS, use the Scout menu's **Open Scout** and **Show diagnostic log** actions. A packaged startup failure should display an alert naming the log. If Finder still does nothing, verify the DMG checksum, move Scout into Applications, use Control-click → Open once, and inspect `~/Documents/Scout Workspace/logs/ui-stdout.log` before reporting a synthetic error summary.

If Setup temporarily cannot reach the local Scout server, select **Retry** after the server is available. Retry reconnects in place: it does not reload the page or discard answers you have entered in the current onboarding or retuning step.

## Private backup cannot be enabled

Backup is optional. Confirm Git and Git Credential Manager are installed, restart Scout after installation, and use a credential-free `https://github.com/owner/repository` URL. Connecting a local workspace requires an empty Private repository; use **Restore my existing workspace** for a repository that already contains Scout data. Scout refuses public repositories and refuses to push `.env`, generated PDF/DOCX files or other sensitive ignored paths when they are already tracked in Git.

## Backup is offline, pending, or needs attention

**Offline — saved locally** means Scout made a local commit and will retry later. **Needs attention** means both the computer and GitHub have new history; Scout deliberately does not reset, rebase, merge or force-push. Preserve both copies and resolve the Git history manually before selecting **Retry**. Never delete `.git`, `.scout/sync.json` or `.scout-backup/` as a conflict workaround.

## A scan reviewed candidates but kept zero

This is not automatically a failed scan. Scout shows the number reviewed, number kept and the discard breakdown (hard exclusions, mandatory gates, below-threshold results and provider assessment discards), with links to the bounded candidate audit and dated report. Check source health first. If a first/manual primary scan keeps zero, Scout automatically runs one broader discovery pass while retaining every approved gate. If both passes keep zero, use **Review this scan** to inspect concise role-level reasons. Do not weaken a genuine hard gate merely to produce results.

## A PDF is missing, stale or blank

Select the master or tailored source and choose its explicit save-and-render action. Keep Scout open while the background operation runs. A source edit makes the previous PDF stale immediately; render again. If rendering fails, Scout preserves the old file but will not preview or download it as current. Run `scout doctor` and repair/reinstall Scout when the managed Typst runtime is missing. Do not install an unrelated system Typst merely to mask a damaged package.

Scout refuses to start a scan when the approved profile, calibration or master CV is incomplete. If Setup reports an empty activated master CV and offers the validated recovery control, use it there; Scout backs up the current file and restores only the hash-checked reviewed staging copy. If the control is unavailable, preserve the workspace and inspect the reported mismatch.

## A tracker change conflicts with a scan

Scout briefly waits when a scan is finishing, then refreshes and retries a stale tracker change once. If the scan is still running, Scout reports that it did not overwrite the tracker. Wait for the scan to finish and repeat the change; do not edit `data/opportunities.json` or remove `.scout-scan.lock` while a live scan is active.

## Restore fails

Restore requires an empty target folder, the private repository HTTPS URL, and either the passphrase or emergency recovery key. Scout rejects malformed/tampered recovery data, symlinks, unsupported workspace schemas and workspaces that fail `scout doctor`. Codex/Claude authentication is not restored; sign in to the provider separately. Startup and scheduled scans require explicit confirmation on the new computer.

Scout validates the restored workspace both before and after activation. If the post-activation check fails, it removes the rejected restored data and returns the original empty target folder instead of leaving a partly activated workspace behind.

## SmartScreen or checksum mismatch

Unsigned beta installers may trigger SmartScreen. Compare `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256` with the release checksum. If it differs, do not run the file; download again from the official release. A matching checksum does not replace antivirus scanning or code signing.

Scout streams an in-app update into a restricted temporary file and computes SHA-256 as bytes arrive. It renames the package to its final download name only after the complete checksum matches; an interrupted, oversized or mismatched download removes its partial file and does not replace an existing verified package.
